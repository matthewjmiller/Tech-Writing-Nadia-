My blog will be Accuracy in Agriculture. Every post will explore a different "controversial" topic within agriculture like GMOs, presticides, climate change, etc. I will look at research and data to write a blog post clarifying what is true and what is false in terms of agriculture topics. 
So what? Food topics is a popular trend right now with consumers very concerned about where their food comes from. There are many different opinions and statements out there and people want to know the truth. People who are intereted in agriculture, food, and the scientific research behnid it will be my audience. 

I can write very specifically on my car. The color, make, model, year of the car. I can tell you where every dent is on the car, scratch, and stain. I can tell you what is hiding in the compartments in the back pockets, doors, and glove box. I can tell you what shoes. clothes, and mattress pad are hanging out in the back that have been left there. I can tell you that the back tires are starting to wear a little bit. The check engine light should be on, but has burned out along with the cruise control light. I can tell you that the cruise control button has worn off in the middle. I also have bumper stickers that decpit Ronald Reagan.
