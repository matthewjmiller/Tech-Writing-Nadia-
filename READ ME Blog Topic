My blog will be Accuracy in Agriculture. Every post will explore a different "controversial" topic within agriculture like GMOs, presticides, climate change, etc. I will look at research and data to write a blog post clarifying what is true and what is false in terms of agriculture topics. 
So what? Food topics is a popular trend right now with consumers very concerned about where their food comes from. There are many different opinions and statements out there and people want to know the truth. People who are intereted in agriculture, food, and the scientific research behnid it will be my audience. 

I can write very specfically on different parts of agricutlure specifically GMOs and cattle. I know the terms and have had expeirence either on my family farm or while working at Monsanto, the GMO giant. I also know a lot about the cosmetics industry from my time working at Ulta Beauty and my own experiences.
