My experience with the first assignment is conflicting. I really like how we had free reign on what we wanted to cover and how we wanted to approach it. However, having little to know outline/guide did stress me out a little bit. GitHub has been an adjustment. I know the purpose of using it to so that we focus more on the content and less on the format. but I have had the opposite experience with that. I am more worried about making sure I spell everything correctly and use the write coding to make sure it looks good. I actaully enjoyed writing the introductions. I prefer more research/ informative writing than I do instructional. I honestly thought the wrod count was low for this project. I felt that I would have left so much out if I limited myself to only a 1000ish words. It also would have been nice to have worked step-by-step on this. It seemed like we covered a lot about the introduction, but hardly anything on the instructional portion and FAQ of the assignment. Having more infromation and direction would have helped me narrow down. I know college should not always be about producing what you think is good, not what the professor wants, but I felt lost in parts of it.
