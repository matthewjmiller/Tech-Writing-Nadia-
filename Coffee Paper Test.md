# Coffee Bean Marketing Paper #
People **love** coffee. Americans **love** coffee. College students **love** coffee. It is a part of many cultures and diets across the world. The World Atlas lists Europe, Brazil, and of course the United States as being the top coffee drinkers in the world. From all these countries, Megan Willet at Business Insider reported that 1.6 billion cups of coffee are drank every single day, which means that 2 million cups are consumed every five minutes. Willet also reports that it was a man named Omar who first discovered how to make coffee by boiling coffee beans in hot water. Coffee soon became popular in Africa and the Middle East (Willet). Allison Helmer from New York Serious Eats outlines the rise of the popularity of coffee, but says that at first coffee was not that popular. Tea was the drink of choice for early colonists. That was *until* the Boston Tea Party in 1773. The Coffee Exchange of New York was born in 1882 and transformed the coffee industry in the US. Helmer said that coffee grew after the exchange was established because it became “a beverage which could be accessible to those outside the wealthy class and still taste good”. The 1950’s saw even more consumption of coffee after the idea of a coffee break was invented. Starbucks, as well as many other coffee companies, were created in the 1970’s giving us the coffee culture that we have today (Helmer).
## History of Coffee ##
The production of coffee has also evolved over the years. Willet describes the ways that coffee is harvested: striping, comb, mechanical, and hand precision. Strip harvesting uses human hands to remove the beans from the flowers. The comb method uses a comb to sort through the fruit on the trees, this is an uncommon method due to the fact that it is time consuming. All of the fruits are shook off of the tree using a vibrating machine in the mechanical method. Hand precision is like the stripping method, but they only pick the ripe cherries off of the tree (Willett). The world atlas counted down the top coffee producing countries, Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia were at the top. However, it looks as though these countries are not producing as much. Over the years, Fortune Magazine cites that the amount of coffee bean producers has lowered. Vietnam saw a *La Nina* year in 2016 hurting their crops. Brazil is expected to face a similar situation, with a potential frost, creating a drop in the coffee bean production. Vietnam is only expected to harvest 26.5 million bags compared to 27.5 million from the previous year. That is a 3.6% decrease in just one year. Brazil could potentially see a 21% decrease in crop going from 55 to 43.2 million pounds. The estimate for carryover is unclear. They range from 8 million in deficit to 10 million surplus for 16/17 (Fortune) The United States Department of Agriculture believes that the ending stock for the United States from 2016 is 6 million bags. For the world ending stocks, there was a 600,000 bag decrease, or 1.7%, resulting in 34.8 million bags. Danny Lewis from the Smithsonian mentions that the Robusta coffee bean, the most common coffee bean, is becoming increasingly harder to grow due to the warm and dry weather. Other factors that have hurt farmers growing coffee have been fungus and fertilizer costs. In fact, due to issues that farmers are having, especially the weather, Lewis believes that many coffee bean farmers could end up “out of luck and out of business by 2050.” (Lewis) 
## Coffee Craze ##
Like I said before, Americans love coffee. The Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health said that Americans drink **3.1 cups** of coffee a day, at 9 ounces a cup equals out to 27.9 ounces of coffee a day. Economically, Americans spend up to **$40 billion** dollars a year on coffee. Danny Lewis quotes Marvin Perez by saying “The bulk of the world’s java-lovers are young people between the ages of 19 to 34, who are drinking more coffee than ever before. While older generations may be drifting away from the brew, so many more young people are more than making up for any resulting drop in coffee drinkers” Lewis.  Across the globe the demand for coffee is expected to rise. Time Magazine Business writer Sabrina Toppa chronicles the increase by quoting the International Coffee Organization executive director Robert Silvia by saying, “Consumption is increasing as societies in India, China and Latin America continue to be westernized.” This westernization could create a 25% increase in coffee consumption in just the next 5 years (Toppa). Fortune Magazine pointed out that the demand in 15/16 was more than the supply was, causing a deficit (Fortune). With the rapid growth in demand, another deficit is possible. However, America is importing less coffee which is partly due to the lower production of coffee. The USDA was importing 300,000 bags less in 2016, an 11% drop in imports (USDA). Leia Toovey from the Economic Calendar quoted the International Coffee Organization by saying, “Globally, a coffee deficit is expected… the coffee market will be in a supply shortage of 3.5 million 60 kg bags of coffee for the year … with output at 151.6 million bags and consumption at 155.1 million.”  Those 3.5 million bags represent a 2.3% difference between supply and demand (Toovey). 			
## Trouble in Paradise and Supply ##
Weather has a large impact on all crops, but especially on coffee. I have previously mentioned how the weather has caused problems in production. The main concern with weather has been the hotter climates. Phillip Ross, writer at the International Business Times, explained that in Africa a single Celsius degree drop can end up causing a 14% decrease in yield. Just one degree can cause that much damage. Unfortunately, the Earth’s temperature is estimated to heat up between 2 and 2.5 degrees Celsius in the next few decades. This increase could cause up to a 28% decrease in production (Ross). On top of the warmer weather, an expected La Nina year could cause more issues with a drought. Droughts often cause a spike in prices because of the inventory scare. 
## Market Trading ##
Contracts for coffee beans weigh in at 37,500 pounds and market in U.S dollars per pound. The minimum price fluctuation is $0.0005 per pound. Because countries outside of the U.S. are the primary ones that grow the beans, it is not a deliverable commodity. There are two types of coffee beans, Robusta and Arabica, and the futures does not determine which is sold in the contract. The only months that you can trade coffee beans are March, May, July, September, and December. Coffee is categorized under the Softs section for commodities (Chicago Merchant Exchange). 
	From its humble beginnings of being boiled in a pot to being steamed in an espresso machine, coffee has become a global staple. However, it looks as if we might be short on coffee for the upcoming year. The short supply is the number one reason why I am going to buy coffee beans. The supply has dropped drastically and looks like it will continue decrease. While America and Europe are some of the top coffee drinking countries, many of the developing countries are increasing consumption. Having a low supply and high demand can often lead to a deficit of the commodity, which is expected for 17/18. One of the main causes of the supply shortage is the weather. We have seen the temperature be unusually high, and a lack of precipitation. Both of these factors have had a negative effect on production. Theses weather conditions hurt the already struggling production. These three main reasons, supply, demand, and weather, are all pointing towards a price increase. I will purchase 10 contracts of December 2017 coffee beans at $1.4805 per pound. The stops for my contracts, or where I will pull out of the, will be $0.50 per pound. Since there are 37,500 pounds per contract, that is equal to $18,750 either direction.
