My topic for our how to paper will be "How to Manage Community Online Using Spredfast" Spredfast is a software that I used over the summer while I worked at Monsanto. In it I will talk about how readers will need to be mentaly prepared to read and responde to hate comments along with the pratical hard skill compenents of using Spredfast to correctly select the sentiment, topic, sub topic, and close the comment or mention. If the comment needs a response, I will then walk them through the Community Response Playbook.
